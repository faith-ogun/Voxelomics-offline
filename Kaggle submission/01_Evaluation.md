# Voxelomics Offline - Judge-Style Evaluation (Agentic Workflow Focus)

Date: February 16, 2026
Track focus: Main Track + Agentic Workflow Prize

## Score Estimate (current state)

1. Effective use of HAI-DEF models (20%): 18/20  
MedASR + MedGemma + Path Foundation are used in a coherent end-to-end workflow.

2. Problem domain (15%): 14/15  
Clear clinical pain point (MDT prep under time pressure) and clear user journey.

3. Impact potential (15%): 12/15  
Strong potential; impact quantification can still be sharpened in submission materials.

4. Product feasibility (20%): 14/20  
Mostly feasible and working, but runtime consistency has had edge-case instability.

5. Execution and communication (30%): 18/30  
App quality is high, but final submission assets (video/writeup/repro packaging) must be tightened.

Estimated current total: 76/100

Estimated with final polish: 86-91/100

## Special Prize Recommendation

- Agentic Workflow Prize fit: Strong
- Novel Task Prize fit: Moderate

Recommendation: Submit to Main Track + Agentic Workflow Prize.

## Strengths judges will likely reward

- Real multi-agent orchestration with stage decomposition.
- Clear clinician-in-the-loop safety gate before final recommendation lock.
- Offline-first architecture aligned with challenge motivation.
- Integration of three relevant HAI-DEF models in one workflow.

## Risks judges may penalize if not addressed in materials

- Any perceived mismatch between claims and what is quantitatively shown.
- Ambiguous reproducibility for judges (packaging/setup friction).
- Output variability not acknowledged with transparent limitations.
